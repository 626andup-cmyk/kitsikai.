/**
 * Jev: the fast decision model (stage 7).
 *
 * Kitsikai makes lots of small yes/no calls: did that message say you had a
 * headache? Is this note still true? Should this pin come down? A chat
 * model *could* answer those, but it's slow, costly, and answers in words
 * that then have to be read. **Jev** ([TypeSafe](https://typesafe.ai), on
 * nanoGPT) is built for exactly this: you give it some **state** (what's
 * going on, as text) and some **questions** with fixed options, and it
 * returns, for each question, the option it picks and a **probability** for
 * every option. It never writes words, and can't read images.
 *
 *   state:     "Newest message: 'ugh my head is killing me' ..."
 *   question:  "Did they say they had a headache?"  options: yes, no
 *   answer:    yes (probabilities: yes 0.94, no 0.06)
 *
 * "Can't hallucinate" means its answers are never malformed (always one of
 * the options), **not** that they're never wrong. So every answer is read in
 * three tiers (`tier`): **confident yes**, **confident no**, or **unsure**,
 * and unsure always takes the safe path (keep the note, ask you, leave the
 * pin up). The line between them is the confidence setting (default 0.8).
 *
 * ## The request
 *
 * Jev is called through Chat Completions with a "questions" response format
 * (DESIGN.md): a map of named questions, each a choice with its options
 * described (`jevRequestBody`). The first live test found the shape (the
 * questions have to be a map, not a list); the reply is read forgivingly
 * (`readAnswers` accepts several layouts). Settings → "Test Jev" sends one
 * tiny question and shows the raw reply, for checking exactly this.
 *
 * ## If Jev isn't reachable
 *
 * DESIGN.md notes nanoGPT listed Jev as "Unavailable" once. So a **fallback**
 * can be set: a normal connection profile that's asked the same questions
 * and told to answer in JSON with a probability (`askProfile`). It's slower
 * and less calibrated, but keeps everything working. Without one, a failed
 * Jev call just means that decision is skipped this time.
 *
 * ## The Jev log
 *
 * Every call is recorded as it happened (`JevCall`): what asked, the request
 * exactly as sent, the reply exactly as received, any error, and the
 * fallback's request and reply if it was asked. The server keeps the last
 * 36 hours of them (src/jevlog.ts), for Settings → "Jev log".

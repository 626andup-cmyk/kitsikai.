/**
 * The Jev log: every call to Jev from the last 36 hours, exactly as it went.
 *
 * Each row is one `JevCall` (src/jev.ts): what asked ("Scratchpad check",
 * "Processing"...), the request exactly as sent, the reply exactly as
 * received, any error, and the fallback profile's request and reply if it
 * was asked. It's for seeing what Jev is told and what it says back: why a
 * note was or wasn't made, which register it picked, what went wrong.
 *
 * It's a **rolling** log: anything older than 36 hours is deleted whenever
 * a call is added or the log is read, so it never grows past a day and a
 * half of calls. It stays on your phone, like everything else.
 *
 * Times come from the caller (`now`), so tests can move the clock.

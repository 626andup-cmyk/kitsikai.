/**
 * Getting JSON out of a model's reply.
 *
 * When a normal chat model is asked for "JSON only", it usually obliges, but
 * not always tidily: the JSON can come wrapped in ```json fences, after a
 * sentence like "Here are the shifts:", with a trailing comma, or with curly
 * quotes. `extractJson` finds the JSON and repairs what it safely can, the
 * same way src/toolcalls.ts forgives broken tool arguments.
 *
 * (Jev, the decision model from stage 7, never needs this: its answers are
 * typed by design. This is for the vision model and the processing writer.)
